# Scrum

Scrum is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing agile. With scrum, the product is built in a series of fixed-length iterations called *sprints* that give teams a framework for shipping software on a regular cadence. 

Short iterations also reinforce the importance of good estimation and fast feedback from tests–both recurring struggles in waterfall projects.

## Roles
Before start talking about Scrum in depth. First, you need to understand the key roles defined by Scrum.

### Product Owner (PO)
The holder of the product value.

The Product Owner is expected to do the best possible job of satisfying all stakeholders, maintain the Product Backlog, and ensure that everyone knows the priorities.

### Scrum Master (SM)
> The servant leader.

The Scrum Master helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions.

### Development Team
The self-organizing group.

Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes overall efficiency and effectiveness.

## Artifacts

### Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. It consistently changes to identify what the product needs to be useful for users. It lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in the future releases. As product is used and gains value, feedback is provided and the Backlog becomes larger. 

*Requirements never stop changing. Changes in business requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog.*

### Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and achieving the Sprint Goal. 

The Sprint Backlog defines the work the development team will perform to turn Product Backlog items into a “Done” Increment. The Sprint Backlog makes visible all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal.

#### Backlog Item
  - Has a Title, a Summary, an ID, a Value, and a Description
  - Can be described as a User Story
    - What, Why and Who
  - Acceptance Criteria

## Meetings
Scrum defines four meetings (or ceremonies): Planning, Daily, Review and Retrospective.

### Planning
A team planning meeting that determines what to complete in the coming sprint. Tasks are selected from the product backlog, which should be up-to-date, prioritized and estimated. During planning, it is important to know if there is something that will impact on the performance of the team during the next sprint. For example, team members vacation, holidays, work hours, etc.

At this meeting, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master and the development are present. They all discuss the goals of the next sprint, the tasks of each story and also what can and cannot be done by the end of the sprint. About this last item, the development team tells what items can be completed during the sprint.

### Daily stand-up
Daily stand-up is a 15-minute meeting for the development team to sync. Each member tells the rest of the team what he/she is working on. The development team and the scrum master attend to this meeting. Three simple questions help keeping the daily stand-up short and highly objetive:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What am I planning on doing today?
- Am I blocked?

By answering each of these three questions, a member is able to tell what has been achieved so far, what will happen over the course of the day and if there is anything that is preventing a task from being finished.

A daily stand-up isn't meant to be a meeting where people discuss the implementation details in depth. It's meant to be a quick meeting used to get everyone on the same page about the tasks and identify obstacles of the current sprint - if any. 

### Review 
A sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint. Product Owner, Scrum Master and the development team go through the deliverables and analyze the impact of the sprint in the product.

### Retrospective
During the retrospective meeting, everything that isn't related to the product is discussed. It is a review of what did and didn't go well in the last sprint with actions to make the next sprint better. Everyone has a chance to speak about things that they should continue doing, things that they should start doing and other things that should be stopped.

This objective of this meeting is always identify problems that happened before and come up with ideas to prevent these same problems form happening again. The intention is to expose everything that caused a good or bad impact on the performance of the team.
